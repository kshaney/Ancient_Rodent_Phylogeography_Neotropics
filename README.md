# Ancient_Rodent_Phylogeography_Neotropics
Sequences used for ancient rodent phylogeography study published by Gutierrez et al. 

Some of the ancient DNA sequences have a large series of gaps and missing data, which have been replaced with "N". 

There is a combination of Ancient DNA and Modern DNA for two species, Oryzomys couesi and Ototylomys phyllotis, all are partial mitochondrial genome sequences. 

In addition, there are four consensus files (Modern Ototylomys, Modern Oryzomys, Ancient Ototylomys, Ancient Oryzomys) which represent the longest mitochondrial genome sequence possible for each given genus and time period.
